# Droplings: Default Theme v1.0

[Droplings](droplings) is a Mac app to make quick-fire sharing via your [Dropbox account][dropbox] easier and more comfortable.  Its preferences allow you to specify a custom theme for rendering your shared files' preview pages.

This repository contains the most recent version of Droplings' built-in default theme.  Feel free to fork and build your own custom themes to make your shared preview pages more personal.

Please note that this repository contains _everything_ related to the default theme:

  1. the theme's [`index.html`][index-html]
  2. the theme's supporting [asset files][assets] (CSS, images etc.)
  3. the [Heroku][heroku]-related code running the built-in theme's supporting assets server `assets.drpln.gs`

If you're only interested in seeing the themeing example serving as the default theme, number (1) on the above list is all that you need.

For starters, here's a screenshot of the default theme in action.

## Templating Engine

Droplings is making use of [Mustache][mustache], a well-known logic-less templating engine.  You can find all you need to know about its syntax on the [Mustache website][mustache].


## Theme Workflow

The templating process goes like this:

  1. All non-`.html` files will be copied verbatim to the target folder (`~/Dropbox/Public/share/YYYY-MM/…/`).
  2. All `.html` will be run through the templating engine, the resulting files will be written to the target folder (using their original names, i.e. an `index.html` with placeholders in your theme folder will result in an `index.html` filled with live data in the target folder).
  3. The shared file will be copied to a `f` subfolder in the target directory; its name will be normalized a bit.
  
A few notes:

  - Your theme **must** contain an `index.html`.
  - Droplings will ignore subfolders.  Only files in the root folder of your theme are recognized.
  - The default theme only contains one HTML and no JS file.  There's no reason why your theme can't sport more than one HTML file and/or JS files.  The templating engine won't replace keys in JS files, tho, so if you want to set JS variables, do so in a `<script>` block in the HTML file prior to loading your external JS file.
 
   

## Template Placeholders

Here's a list of available template keys/variables with their meaning.

  - `file_link`: the relative path to the shared file as seen from
    `index.html`.
  - `file_ext`: the normalized file extension (trimmed & lowercase).
  - `file_size`: the file size in readable format, eg. "2.70 KB", 
    "5.12 GB".
  - `short_url`: the drpln.gs URL leading to the preview page.
  - `original_filename`: The name of the file as it was when the file was
    shared.
  - `is_archive`: the file is an archive (zip, tgz, rar etc.)
  - `is_audio`: the file is an audio file (mp3, m4a, wav etc.)
  - `is_contact`: the file is a vcard file
  - `is_image`: the file is an image (png, jpg, tiff, gif etc.)
  - `is_message`: the file is a recognized message (email, IM, and so on)
  - `is_pdf`: the file is a mixed content file, i.e. a PDF.
  - `is_text`: the file is text document (html, rtf, mdown etc.)
  - `is_video`: the file is a video (mov, mpg etc.)
  - `is_unknown_type`: the file wasn't recognized as one of the files 
    listed above
  - `is_ext_*`: a "dynamic" placeholder — for example, if the shared file
    is a GIF then the placeholder `is_ext_gif` would be set.


## Build Notes

For the time being, my "master files" are the HAML/SASS source files residing in `src/`.  These are compiled to HTML/CSS (created in `build/` and `assets/`, respectively) by [LiveReload][livereload].
