# Servus: Default Theme v1.3

[Servus][servus] is a Mac app to make quick-fire sharing via your [Dropbox account][dropbox] easier and more comfortable.  Its preferences allow you to specify a custom theme for rendering your shared files' preview pages.

This repository contains the most recent version of Servus' built-in default theme.  Feel free to fork and build your own custom themes to make your shared preview pages more personal.  **If you're looking for a quicker way to get started, you'll probably want
[servus-theme-boilerplate][boilerplate-github] instead.**

Please note that this repository contains _everything_ related to the default theme:

  1. the theme's [`index.html`][index-html]
  2. the theme's supporting [asset files][assets] (CSS, images etc.)
  3. the [Heroku][heroku]-related code running the built-in theme's supporting assets server `assets.servus.io`

If you're only interested in seeing the themeing example serving as the default theme, number (1) on the above list is all that you need.

For starters, here's a screenshot of the default theme in action.

## Documentation

To learn more about Servus' templating process and what you can do with it,
see [the documentation](https://servus.io/theme-docs.html).


## Build Notes

For the time being, my "master files" are the HAML/SASS source files residing in `src/`.  These are compiled to HTML/CSS (created in `build/` and `assets/`, respectively) by [LiveReload][livereload].
